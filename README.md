# Ao3-skin-Stardust
An Ao3 site skin

Decided to make this just in case anyone has problems with the site skin or modifying it. 
This is only basic troubleshooting if you do complex modifications and know more CSS than me I probably can't help you.

1. 'The site skin doesn't work'

Check that this isn't a known issue. I haven't published this skin directly on ao3 for good reason.
The mobile formatting still needs work but the ipad and light skin are usuable. The darkmmode still needs work.

Make sure you followed the instructions for the ipad and mobile fix exactly. If the media sizing or parent skin settings are wrong the skin won't work. 

Check that the commas you use are straight not curly. It shouldn't happen when you copy paste from Github, but if you copy pasted it to say a MS word document before putting it in Ao3 or did the code modifications in MS word the commas may have changed the curly commas, Ao3's css field doesn't like this for some reason.

Also, on ipad or mobile you device might not be able to handle copying all this code in browser without crashing. So you may have to copy in sections. Genrally, installing this skin on desktop is easier. When copy pasting on desktop, check that you've selected all of the code.


2. 'my modification doesn't work'

Make sure that you didn't accidentally remove any curly brackets or double them up. It will break the CSS code if you do. Also check that you didn't miss any semicolons on the ends of your declarations this will also break the code. Declarations all the bits where you say things like 'make the text black' and they look like this 'color: black;'

If you are British like me make sure you are spelling the word colour the American way.
Like this 'color' because for some reason CSS only accept the American spelling.


2. 'Do you have some advice if I want to modify your coding?'

Always save your code. Back it up on Github or use a basic word editng program. Or
when you try to modify it something will break and you won't be able to back it up with working code.
Use the W3 website to learn code as I personally find they make it quite easy to learn. 
Also please credit me. Although this code is modified for other peoples I have made some changes myself so also credit ElectricAlice and Vanetta!
